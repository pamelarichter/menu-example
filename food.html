          <p>While exploring Israel, you have to stop along the way to try some of Israel’s tastiest dishes. One of them being the Shakshuka, which is the perfect vegetarian breakfast. This dish includes poached eggs in a tomato sauce with chili peppers, garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Another famous dish in Israel is hummus msabba, which is a delicious creamy stable that is eaten with pita bread. Last but not least, you have to try the Falafel, which is deep-fried chickpea balls.</p>

        <h3>Turkey</h3>

          <div class="container">
          <p>Turkish cuisine is very diverse and renowned with plates like kebabs. Turkey offers Kuyu, Iskender, and Adana kebabs. Kebabs in Turkey are amazing, but the sweets are even better. A dish you have to try is Künefe, which is a traditional Arab cheese pastry. Last but not least, my favorite dessert in Turkey, the Baklava, which is made from nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, or pistachios. </p>

        <h3>Egypt</h3>

          <div class="container">
          <p>Egyptian food was very similar to Turkish food, but one of the plates that was different is the Koshary. This plate is made with pasta and lentils and rice, topped with tomato sauce, chickpeas, and fried onions. Another dish I enjoyed there is the Egyptian shawarma the shawarma is sliced and mixed with tomatoes, onions, spices, and another secret fatty like sauce. Then, it’s piled onto a bun or wrapped up and served. Last but not least, my favorite dish there the Molokhia, very dark green and almost slimy like soup made from jute mallow leaves. </p>

          <div class="container">
          <p>While at Jordan, I ate Mansaf, which is a dish of tender meat layered with paper-thin flatbread and enormous piles of aromatic rice. One of my favorite recipes here was the warak enab, which is grape leaves stuffed with a special dressing of rice and meat, cooked in a giant pot. This dish was one of my favorites from all the food I tried in the Middle East. </p>
