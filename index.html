              <p> The Middle East is made up of 16 countries and is probably the least-traveled region in the world due to their conflicts with war. Regardless, there are fantastic destinations for tourists which I will be sharing. </p>
<p>Israel was my first destination with a perfect blend of opposites: it has regions rich with history and cities that are full-on high tech. Tel Aviv is a dream city for anyone who appreciates food and nightlife. On the other hand, visiting Jerusalem is a fantastic experience as itâ€™s full of centuries building and history that dates back to 3500 B.C.</p>
<p>Jordan was my second destination in the Middle East and is still one of my favorite trips. Seeing Petra for the first time, walking the streets of Amaan, scuba diving in the Dead sea and wondering through the Wadi Rum desert was an incredible experience. </p>
<p>From exploring the beauties in the Wadi Rum desert, I traveled to the Sahara Desert located in Egypt. Egypt is one of the most mysterious destinations between the Nile river, Alexandria, Cairo, and the pyramids that date back to 2500. There is so much history to explore from the pyramids to the museums. </p>
<p>Last but not least, on the edge of the Islamic world and the European Union is Turkey. Visiting Turkey is one of the easiest and most fascinating ways to explore Islamic Culture. Between the incredible food, the hot air balloon rides over Cappadocia and the impressive mosques.</p>
